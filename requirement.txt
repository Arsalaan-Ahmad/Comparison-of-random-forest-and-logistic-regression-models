Required Libraries and Toolboxes:
1-MATLAB (R2021a or later)
2-Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
3-Data Import and Export Toolbox (for readtable)
4-MATLAB Plotting Tools (for figure, subplot, histogram, heatmap)
5-Parallel Computing Toolbox (for TreeBagger)
Additional Requirements:

Steps to Install Required Toolboxes:
Open MATLAB.
Go to the Home tab.
Click on Add-Ons.
Search for the required toolboxes (e.g., "Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox").
Install the toolboxes.

Example Code to Check and Install Toolboxes:
requiredToolboxes = {'Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox', 'Data Import and Export Toolbox', 'Parallel Computing Toolbox'};
installedToolboxes = matlab.addons.installedAddons();

for i = 1:length(requiredToolboxes)
    if ~any(strcmp(installedToolboxes.Name, requiredToolboxes{i}))
        fprintf('Installing %s...\n', requiredToolboxes{i});
        matlab.addons.install(requiredToolboxes{i});
    else
        fprintf('%s is already installed.\n', requiredToolboxes{i});
    end
end

Make sure you have these toolboxes installed to ensure the code runs without any issues.



Also if you want to run this code make sure to change data path to location of the data on your device and also the model location as well .
